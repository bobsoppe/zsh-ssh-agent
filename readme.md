# Ssh-agent

> Ssh-agent management for zsh, with additional feature for unlocking private-keys


## Install

1. Eitherâ€¦
  - Clone this repo
  - add it as a submodule, or
  - just download `ssh-agent.zsh`

2. Source `ssh-agent.zsh` in your '.zshrc'


3. (optional)

   - create `unlock_ids` file in the `$HOME/.ssh/unlock_ids`
   - see the [example file](unlock_ids.template) on how to write it

This will look for a matching entry within the `unlock_ids` file and
will use the corresponding command to unlock the private key.

> NOTE: Bare in mind the security risk that comes with this plugin-feature!
